# fCC's "Number Guessing Game" Project
This is just the repository needed for completing the fcc project. It contains the database with the tables created but no data in them as well as the script file to play the actual game.

More information about the actual project can be found on [freeCodeCamp's website](https://www.freecodecamp.org) under the Relational Database section of the Cirriculum.
